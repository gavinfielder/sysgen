# sysgen.cpp

When I was taking ODEs at my undergrad university, the midterm study guide was purely theoretical and we had no good way to practice basic skills of working with systems of first order ODEs.

This is a simple program that generated practice problems for that course. Using a little theory, algebraic trickery, and brute force programming, it generates particular types of systems of 2x2 linear first order ODEs and prints them in matrix form. The user can select which type of systems to create, and when prompted it will also display the type of the system (a vital part of the answer) each matrix constitutes.
